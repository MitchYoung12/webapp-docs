OWASP Top 10 2021,Definition,Example
Broken Access Control (A01:2021),"Access control enforces policy such that users cannot act outside of their intended permissions. Failures typically lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification, or destruction of all data or performing a business function outside the user's limits.",An application that allows users to access admin functions by simply changing the URL from `/user` to `/admin` without proper authentication checks.
Cryptographic Failures (A02:2021),"Cryptographic failures, previously known as sensitive data exposure, occur when critical data is not properly protected in transit or at rest.",Storing passwords in plaintext in the database instead of hashing them with a strong algorithm.
Injection (A03:2021),"Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker’s hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.","A web application allows users to submit their usernames, but the input is not sanitized. An attacker can input a malicious SQL command (`' OR '1'='1`) to bypass authentication."
Insecure Design (A04:2021),"Insecure design is a broad category representing different weaknesses, expressed as 'missing or ineffective control design.' It’s about design flaws and the absence of security controls.","A lack of rate limiting on login attempts, allowing an attacker to perform a brute force attack."
Security Misconfiguration (A05:2021),"Security misconfiguration is the most commonly seen issue. This is commonly a result of insecure default configurations, incomplete or ad hoc configurations, open cloud storage, misconfigured HTTP headers, and error messages containing sensitive information.",Leaving the default credentials for an admin account unchanged on a deployed system.
Vulnerable and Outdated Components (A06:2021),"This occurs when the libraries, frameworks, and other software modules used in applications are out-of-date or contain known vulnerabilities.",Using a version of a web framework with known security vulnerabilities that have not been patched.
Identification and Authentication Failures (A07:2021),"This category encompasses identification and authentication failures. Previously known as broken authentication, it refers to improper implementation of authentication and session management.","An application not invalidating session tokens after a user logs out, allowing an attacker to reuse the token to access the user's session."
Software and Data Integrity Failures (A08:2021),"Software and data integrity failures relate to code and infrastructure that do not protect against integrity violations. For example, an application without integrity checks on serialized objects.","An application that does not verify the integrity of software updates, allowing an attacker to supply a malicious update."
Security Logging and Monitoring Failures (A09:2021),"Inadequate logging and monitoring, coupled with ineffective or missing integration with incident response, allows attackers to further attack systems, maintain persistence, pivot to more systems, and tamper, extract, or destroy data.","Failing to log failed login attempts, making it difficult to detect and respond to brute force attacks."
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (A10:2021),"SSRF flaws occur whenever a web application is fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL. This allows attackers to coerce the application to send a crafted request to an unexpected destination, even if protected by a firewall, VPN, or another type of network ACL.",An attacker tricks the server into fetching a URL that accesses internal resources like `http://localhost/admin`.
